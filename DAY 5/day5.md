# Day 5 

## What I did today:

- Installed **Node.js** to prepare for React and other JavaScript-based projects  
- Updated **README files** for clarity and documentation  
- Set up **React** environments for my front-end projects  
- Reviewed **all repositories** thoroughly since today is my lab exam day — made sure everything is clean and ready  
- Worked on the **Compiler Construction project** in Python on REPLify  
  - Learned how to use `colorama` for terminal colors  
  - Created a **Custom Python REPL** with advanced features:
    - Tokenization with error logging  
    - Command history saved with timestamps  
    - Environment stats and variable tracking  
    - Debug mode with step-by-step code evaluation  
    - Built-in helpful commands like `help`, `history`, `tokens`, `env`, `debug`, `clear`, and `exit()`  
- Explored the **SISL Compiler** project (Smart Irrigation Scheduling Language) from compiler construction lab exam  
  - Automates irrigation based on soil moisture, weather, crop type, and time  
  - Includes parsing, semantic analysis, symbol table management, and code generation for irrigation controllers

## Tools & Tech Used:

- **Node.js & React** — for front-end development  
- **Python 3.x** — for compiler and REPL projects  
- **colorama module** — for colorful terminal output (`pip install colorama`)  

---

## Notes

- The Python REPL project is a cool way to understand how Python interprets code internally, with tokenization and debugging built-in  
- SISL Compiler ties compiler concepts with real-world applications like smart irrigation  
- Feeling confident after reviewing all repos and setting up dev environments — ready for lab exam!  

---

## Next Steps

- Finish documenting all projects thoroughly  
- Continue improving REPL features and testing compiler code generation  
- Start integrating React projects with backend APIs  

---

*Personal reminder: Keep pushing forward! Every bit of practice counts.*
