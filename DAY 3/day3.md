  - Learned and practiced Git basics: `cd`, `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, and branch management.
- Successfully **set up professional, well-documented GitHub repositories** for:
  - A **React-based Todo App** recognized as the **Second Best Submission** in a MERN Bootcamp.
  - A **Library Management System** developed in Assembly Language on the EMU8086 platform.
- Updated and enhanced the **README files** for both projects, ensuring clarity and professionalism.
- Shared live demo link for the Todo App for easy access and presentation.

## üìù Reflection

Day 3 was highly productive in strengthening my **version control skills** and project documentation abilities. Although no new coding was done, mastering Git workflows and enhancing README documentation is critical for professional development and open-source contributions. Reviewing React app structure and Assembly basics reinforced my foundation for upcoming challenges.
