# 100 Days Challenge – Day 2 Notes What I did today

- Uploaded two big projects to GitHub:
  - BST Dictionary Management System (C++ using Binary Search Tree)
  - Bank Network System Simulation (Cisco Packet Tracer)
- Spent time organizing the repos and making README files clearer
- Brushed up on DSA stuff for the BST project — how insertion, searching, and deletion work fast
- Practiced using file handling in C++ to save data even after the program closes
- Tried to keep the code neat and documented so it’s easy to revisit later or for others to understand



### What I learned

**Data Structures & Algorithms:**

- BSTs keep data sorted dynamically — cool how recursive insertion and traversal work
- Inorder traversal shows data alphabetically
- Recursion is super useful for tree operations
- File I/O in C++ helps save/load data, which makes projects practical

**Project Management:**

- Clear README files are a lifesaver — explaining goals and how to use projects
- Good project structure helps navigate big codebases easily

**Networking Simulation (Bonus):**

- Got my hands on Cisco Packet Tracer for the banking network simulation
- Learned basics about network security, IoT integration, and centralized servers

### Tools I used

- C++ (BST and file handling)
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Cisco Packet Tracer for network simulation
- Markdown for writing documentation

### Reflection

Uploading the projects felt great — it’s the first step to turning theory into practice. Understanding BSTs plus file handling can really make projects powerful and useful. Keeping things organized and documented is key for future work or sharing with others.

*That’s it for today. Feeling motivated to keep the momentum going!*
