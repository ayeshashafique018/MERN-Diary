# 💖 MERN DIARY: My 100 Days of Code Journey 💻 
✨ where bugs meet vibes and consistency wins 

Hey you! Yes, *you* scrolling through my repo 👀  
Welcome to my **coding diary**, where I’ve taken on the ✨ *legendary challenge* ✨ of coding for **100 days straight** — no excuses, just vibes and VS Code! 
📚 Yes, even if exams sneak in.
😴 Yes, even on lazy summer days.
💪 Yes, because I believe in growth one line of code at a time.  
Because this girl’s got GOALS and GIT.

🎯 **What’s this repo about?**  
It’s my little pink planet of progress —  
- Every day gets its own cute folder (like `Day 1`, `Day 2` etc.)  
- If it’s a chill day, I’ll drop a lil' `dayX.md` log to show I did *something* 🙌  
- From tiny practice to big projects — *everything counts!*

🌼 **This isn't just code... it's a digital diary.**  
With every `console.log(“yay!")`, I’m reminding myself:  
✨ *“You got this, keep going!”* ✨

So here’s to  
🌈 learning  
🌈 unlearning  
🌈 relearning  
🌈 and slaying bugs like a boss 🐞💅
