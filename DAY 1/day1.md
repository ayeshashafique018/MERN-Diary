# 🌸 Day 1 – MERN Diary: My Coding Chronicles Begin!


> 🧠 Mood: Excited + Nervous + Determined = POWER MODE 💪  
> 🎯 Goal: Kick off my 100 Days of MERN journey by uploading my past projects and organizing my repo.


## ✅ What I Did Today:

- Created a brand new GitHub repository called **MERN-DIARY** ✨
- Organized the repo structure to track every day’s progress under folders like `Day 1`, `Day 2`, etc.
- Uploaded **two previously completed major projects**:
  - 💼 **Hostel Management System** (Java + SQL Server – our DBMS project)
  - 👗 **Gracious Garments Website** (HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap – frontend website)

---

## 🧠 What I Learned / Revisited:

- How to push local project files to GitHub and organize commits like a pro 🔄
- Markdown formatting for making cute and clean project descriptions ✍️
- Structured how I want to maintain this diary — each day = a folder or `.md` file 📁
- Got back into the vibe of project documentation and felt how far I’ve come already! 🥹💻

## 💡 Thoughts & Reflection:

Even though today I didn't build something *new-new*, I’ve taken the most powerful first step — **I started**.  
This repo will be my public accountability partner, my portfolio journal, and my safe little dev-space ✨

Exams or not, **I’m ready for this 100-day challenge** — with Allah’s help. InshAllah I’ll stay consistent, no matter what!


## 🐾 Little Wins:

- [x] Started the MERN Diary 📔  
- [x] Uploaded 2 awesome past projects 💻  
- [x] Committed to the challenge publicly 💬
