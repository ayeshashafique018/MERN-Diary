## 🕓 Time Check  
It's 4:00 PM now.

## 🚀 What I've Done So Far  
- Built some projects using **React** — feeling good about that.  
- Got an overview of **MERN stack** as well.  
- Core JavaScript concepts still a bit fuzzy, but working on it.  
- 5 days done and dusted!

## 🎯 Today's Focus  
- From today onwards, besides working on projects, I’ll make sure to really **master the core concepts** of JavaScript.  
- Opened code along with Harry Sigma’s web dev course.  
- Starting to learn **JavaScript, Node.js, and everything from scratch**, focusing on full concepts.  
- Working on new.js, script.js, index.html files — all organized in a repo.

## 💪 Motivation Boost  
- Eid is near — gotta keep this motivation strong!  
- I’ll do my best to keep Starek (my project) ongoing.  
- Also, need to prepare for final exams — balancing both!
