# Day 4 

Today I uploaded and worked on some cool projects that I’m really proud of and wanted to keep track of:


## Online Voting Management System

- Made in Java with MS Access database
- Aimed to make voting easier, secure, and transparent
- Features: user login, candidate registration, vote casting, and result display
- Used Java Swing (JFrame) for GUI
- Connected database using JDBC
- Learned a lot about OOP concepts like polymorphism and abstraction

## Assembly Line Scheduling Problem (ALSP)

- Written in C++
- Created a greedy algorithm to schedule jobs on assembly lines efficiently
- Took into account worker availability, job dependencies, and machine downtime
- Tried to minimize total production time (makespan)
- Also made it visualize scheduling with Gantt charts (in theory)
- Compared my algorithm with others like FCFS and SJF
- This one was tricky but super rewarding for learning algorithms


## Summary

- Uploaded projects to GitHub
- Practiced Java GUI and database integration
- Improved algorithm skills with C++ scheduling problem
- Felt good sharing these projects because my dad liked the voting system a lot and told everyone about it :)
- Day 4 felt productive and I’m excited to keep building more
